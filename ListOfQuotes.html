			<h2>He's a sorcerer; he knows how to disappear</h2>
			<div class="expandable">
				<p>Chapter 12 Page 94: "He actually <i>thought</i> of himself as a Sorcerer, that’s how it seemed to me, and Kathy was his main audience.  I can’t see how she put up with it. Maybe she hoped he’d pull off a real miracle or something.  For her own life, I mean.  I guess sometimes my sister thought of him as a Sorcerer too." - Patricia Hood</p>
				<p>Chapter 12 Page 97: "In every trick there are two carefully thought out lines-the way it looks and the way it is.  The success of your work depends upon your understanding the relationship of these lines." -Robert Parrish (The Magician’s Handbook)</p>
				<p>Chapter 23 Page 249: "Later, when he looked back, the yellow cabin was gone. But even then, in his mind’s eye, he could see a man and a woman lying quietly on a porch in the dense night fog…{This man and woman being John and Kathy}... and soon the fog was all around them and inside them and they were swallowed up and gone."<br>Magicians often use smoke (fog works too) to disappear. Magicians also often imagine their trick before it happens so they can be extra sure everything goes as planned. He was imagining their vanishing act to make sure it happened right.</p>
				<p>Chapter 24 Page 262: "Exhibit Eight: John Wade's box of tricks: Invisible ink"<br>John could have written notes to people saying what was going to happen. He could have told Kathy to meet him at this place at this time.</p>
				<p>Chapter 26 Page 269: "He [John] went to the files and dug out a thick folder of morning reports for Charlie Company. Over the next two hours he made the necessary changes, mostly retyping, some scissors work, removing his name from each document and carefully tidying up the numbers."<br>-disappearing act, happened once, could happen again</p>
				<p>Chapter 30 Page 296: "...Number four, the man was a magician. Tried to wipe his name off the Charlie Company rolls, tried to vanish himself and damn near did it..." -Anthony L. (Tony) Carbo</p>

			<h2>Details on how they could have disappeared</h2>
			<div class="expandable">
				<p>Chapter 28 Page 276 talks about how nice and expensive the boat was. It seems it would be good for running away. A topped off tank could give him 250 miles to travel.</p>
				<p>Chapter 28 Page 282: “Winnipeg’s not such a bad place.”</p>
				<p>Chapter 29 Page 287: "Two duck hunters lost their way in 1958, never to find it again, never to be found."<br> This shows how it is very easy to get lost in the Lake of the Woods, so John and Kathy could have easily ran away, and nobody would find them.</p>
				<p>Chapter 29 Page 287: "The nearest city is Winnipeg, 122 miles to the west. The nearest bus station is in Roseau, 47 miles to the southwest. The nearest full-time law enforcement officer is in Baudette, the county seat, a 90 mile plane ride over the Lake of the Woods."<br>This shows how there is not much of anything in The Lake of the Woods, but if they wanted to run away together they could go to the bus station or go to the nearest city.</p>
				<p>Chapter 31 Page 301: "Maybe they wrapped themselves in blankets and fell asleep and woke up happy, and maybe in the morning they set a bearing north toward Kenora, or west toward Winnipeg, where they would have ditched the Chris Craft and made their way on foot to a bus station or to a small private airport"</p>
				<p>Lake of the Woods, scenic lake astride the Canadian–United States boundary where the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba and the state of Minnesota meet. Relatively shallow and irregular in shape, it is 70 miles (110 km) long and up to 60 miles (95 km) wide and has an area of 1,727 square miles (4,472 square km). The lake has an estimated 25,000 miles (40,000 km) of shoreline and more than 14,000 islands. Fed from the southeast by the Rainy River, the lake drains northwestward through the Winnipeg River into Lake Winnipeg. Its elevation is 1,060 feet (323 m) above sea level, and the drainage area is 27,170 square miles (70,370 square km).</p>

			<h2>Why they wanted to run away</h2>
			<div class="expandable">
				<p>Chapter 25 Page 265: "[B. Tavern’s] longing to vanish, in death, without a trace and to return to the elements from which he came echoes his lifelong hunger for anonymity, for disappearing without a name, or with a fictitious name, so that his true identity would be lost forever. The life of a pseudonym is the life of a dead man, of one who does not exist." - Karl S. Guthke (B. Tavern)<br>John wanted to vanish. He ran away, disappearing, leaving everything behind out of the blue. He did not want to exist after he lost the election.</p>
				<p>Chapter 28 Page 280: “No objective but to lose himself and stay lost.” “Despite everything, his mood was curiously festive, his morale high, and it occurred to him that happiness itself was subject to relativity.  He took out his bottle and sang ‘I’ll be Home for Christmas.’”  John seems like he is determined and has some sort of plan.</p>
				<p>Chapter 30 Page 290: “There was one clue, I guess… Kathy was getting ready to head up north, and so naturally I asked when she’d be back in the office. Like a general date, I meant. Anyway, she goes over to this window. She looks out for a while and finally starts to laugh, except it wasn’t real laughing. Like she knew something” (Bethany Kee)<br>Kathy was going north and seemed suspicious about it, hiding something from him.</p>
				<p>Chapter 30 Page 296: “I’m not in the guessing game, I’ll lay out some basic facts. Number one, they were in debt up to their necks. Number two, there wasn’t a dime left in their bank account. Cleaned out slick as a whistle even before they headed up north. Number three, nobody ever found either boat. Not a single scrap, no oars, no life vests... Number whatever, Kathy had her own history. The dentist of hers, the way she used to take off now and then... Maybe she finally did it. Maybe they both had it rigged up all along. When you think about it, they didn’t have a damn thing to come back to- reputation shot, no career, bills up the gazoo.” (Anthony L. (Tony) Carbo)</p>
				<p>“Just like those two weirdo snakes I mentioned. One plus one equals zero!”</p>

				<p>Chapter 28 Page 279: “There’s plenty of space up there to evaporate.  It’s worth some thought.”<br> Claude gives John a radio, a nice boat, and a note suggesting that he should run away. It seems like Claude was in on his plan.</p>
				<p>Chapter 28 Page 281 “Just so you know, Lux and company are probably monitoring this, so if you don’t want nobody to… See what I mean?” -Claude</p>
				<p>Chapter 30 Page 295: “They’re gone and they’re not coming back. Both of them. I mean, honestly, some things you best walk away from, just shrug and say say, Who knows? I’m serious.” (Ruth Rasmussen)<br> Ruth says “both of them”, they could have told Ruth where they are going and that they aren’t ever coming back.</p>

				<p>Chapter 31 Page 299: “Are we so cynical, so sophisticated as to write off even the chance of a happy ending?”</p>
				<p>Chapter 31 Page 299: “Does happiness strain credibility? Is there something in the human spirit that distrusts its own appetites, its own yearning for healing and contentment? Can we not believe that two adults, in love, might resolve to make their own miracle?”</p>
				<p>Chapter 31 Page 300: “Finally it’s a matter of taste, or aesthetics, and the boil is one possibility that I must reject as both graceless and disgusting. Besides, there’s the weight of evidence.  He was crazy about her.”</p>
